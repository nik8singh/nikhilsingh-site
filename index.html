        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Nikhil Singh is a Quality Engineering specialist focused on large-scale, regulated software systems across healthcare, government, and enterprise platforms. His work centers on system reliability, regulatory compliance, and data integrity for distributed systems operating under strict operational and legal requirements.</p>

        <p>Over nine years, he has served in roles responsible for defining QA strategy, release readiness criteria, and risk-based governance for mission-critical platforms mission-critical platforms, including Amazon workforce and delivery partner systems (A to Z and Flex), State of Vermont Agency of Human Services programs, and healthcare product teams supporting Epic-based patient experience workflows. His work includes eligibility and enrollment verification, claims-adjacent processing systems, and integration-heavy platforms that handle sensitive PII/PHI. These environments require defensible quality governance, clear release readiness criteria, and repeatable evidence for compliance-focused stakeholders.</p>

        <p>He has led testing strategy and release readiness practices for high-impact workflows where quality failures can create compliance findings, payment or benefit errors, or service disruption. His background includes API gateway testing, standards-based data exchange validation (including EDI/X12 patterns where applicable), and cross-functional coordination across engineering, product, vendors, and stakeholders to drive stable and compliant delivery.</p>

        <h2>Areas of Expertise</h2>

        <h3>Quality Engineering for Regulated & Enterprise-Scale Systems</h3>
        <p>Designing and executing QA strategies for systems subject to regulatory audit and enterprise operational demands. This includes governing release readiness for state-wide healthcare exchanges and large-scale workforce and delivery platforms where reliability and data integrity are mandatory.</p>

        <h3>Healthcare & Government Eligibility / Enrollment and Claims-Adjacent Workflows</h3>
        <p>Validating CMS-regulated and public service systems involving eligibility determination, enrollment maintenance, verification workflows, and claims-adjacent processing. Focused on high-risk scenarios, policy-driven changes, and evidence that supports audit and compliance review.</p>

        <h3>EDI/X12 and Standards-Based Data Exchange</h3>
        <p>Testing standards-driven transactions and integrations used in healthcare and government workflows, including EDI/X12 patterns where applicable. Emphasis on mapping verification, schema validation, reconciliation, and defect isolation across upstream and downstream systems.</p>

        <h3>API Reliability & Distributed Integration</h3>
        <p>Testing and validating system-to-system integrations, API gateways, and backend workflows to ensure correctness, stability, and operational resilience. Coverage includes contract validation, negative testing, failure-mode testing, and integration monitoring signals that support release readiness.</p>

        <h3>Workforce, Scheduling, and Operational Execution Workflows</h3>
        <p>Testing high-impact operational workflows that depend on distributed services and multiple integrations, where reliability and data correctness directly affect service continuity. Focused on failure-mode coverage, reconciliation, and release readiness signals for integration-heavy systems.</p>

        <h3>Performance and Load Testing for High-Transaction Systems</h3>
        <p>Planning and executing load and stress testing for APIs and integration layers to identify bottlenecks and reliability risks before release. Focused on throughput, latency, error rates, and stability under realistic peak conditions.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility Compliance (Section 508)</h3>
        <p>Integrating accessibility testing into release criteria and remediation workflows for public-facing and compliance-bound systems. Focused on repeatable checks, testable requirements, and stakeholder-ready evidence for accessibility verification.</p>

        <h3>Test Automation for Web and Mobile</h3>
        <p>Building and maintaining automated test coverage for web and mobile applications using industry-standard frameworks and CI-friendly execution patterns. Experience spans UI automation, API automation, regression suites, and automation reporting used for release decisions.</p>

        <h3>Data Validation and SQL-Based Verification</h3>
        <p>Validating complex workflows through direct database verification, reconciliation, and controlled test data setup. Focused on correctness of persisted records, downstream propagation, and detection of outliers that indicate systemic defects.</p>
